# 🔗 Database Management System (DBMS) Relationships

In DBMS, relationships define how data is structured and interconnected across multiple tables. There are three primary types:

## 📌 One-to-One (1:1)
A single record in one table corresponds to a single record in another table.  
**Example:** A `Person` table linked to a `Passport` table, where each person has only one passport.

## 📌 One-to-Many (1:M)
A single record in one table can be associated with multiple records in another table.  
**Example:** A `Customer` table linked to an `Orders` table, where each customer can place multiple orders.

## 📌 Many-to-Many (M:M)
Multiple records in one table can be associated with multiple records in another table.  
**Example:** A `Students` table linked to a `Courses` table, where students can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students.
